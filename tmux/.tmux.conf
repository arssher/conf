# "A session is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the management of
# tmux. Each session has one or more windows linked to it. A window occupies the
# entire screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a
# separate pseudo terminal".
# https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html

# create new session with name:
# tmux new -s sess_name
# attach to latest session:
# tmux a
# attach to specific session:
# tmux a -t <name>
# to create session sharing windows with another session,
# but otherwise independent:
# https://superuser.com/questions/845427/tmux-multiple-instances-of-the-same-session
# tmux new -t sess_name -s sess_name1
# This is called session grouping: on first 'new -t <name>' new
# session group with <name> is created, adding both sessions to it.
# list all sessions:
# tmux ls
# kill all sessions:
# tmux kill-server
# to kill current session, just exit from all panes and windows, or
# tmux kill-session -t <name>
# to detach (exit without killing session)
# C-a d

# setting options:
# set and set-option is the same.
# -w is windows option, -s server, otherwise session
# -g sets 'global' option, it is inherited if there is no more specific one
# (e.g. session doesn't set its own value)

# Enable mouse control (clickable windows, panes, resizable panes)
# this also enables copying into tmux buffer with mouse!
# To scroll to the bottom and start typing in one go just hit 'q'.
set -g mouse on

# btw, valid ascii characters:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30680362/how-to-use-ctrl-semicolon-for-prefix-in-tmux
# remap prefix from 'C-b' to 'C-a': unbind old one...
unbind C-b
# set new one...
set-option -g prefix C-a
# ... and now pressing it twice will send the same character to the underlying program
bind-key C-a send-prefix

# panes:
# " -- split top/bottom
bind - split-window -v  # also -
# % -- split left/right
bind | split-window -h  # also |
# cycle through panes with s
bind-key s select-pane -t :.+

# windows:
# c -- create new
# w -- list and choose
# n -- cycle
# & -- close current (if it hanged)

# reload config file
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

# TPM (plugins) stuff.
# prefix + I installs the plugins.
# List of plugins
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
# save & restore on prefix C-s and prefix C-r
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
# search buffer with 'prefix / <regexps>'
# unfortunately this doesn't work with 2.4 and below...
# install_tmux.sh installs from source
# reasonable regexps look like e.g.
# psql.*$
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat'

# Insane default copypaste:
# C-a [ to enter copy mode
# move to start/end
# C-<space> to start selection
# M-w to finish (copy to tmux clipboard)
# C-a C-] to paste

# See

# to make it saner, tmux-yank plugin is part of it.

# Note that all this copies into system *local* clipboard, obviously. If
# you ssh into somewhere, using tmux there, and want to copy between
# local and remote you need bidi clipboard working by forwarding X
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/572874/copy-text-from-remote-tmux-to-local-x-clipboard
# Alternatively, in most terminal emulators you can use shift + mouse
# to copy text to the system's (that is, local in our case) 'primary'
# buffer -- that's a way to copy remote -> local. local -> remote
# works as is because C-v behavior is not modified, i.e. it
# inserts from local clipboard buffer as usual.

# https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank
# tmux yank
# - will copy mouse selection into system 'primary' clipboard.
#   Apparently that's middle mouse by default.
# - makes 'y' in copy mode copy selection into system 'clipboard'
#   clipboard.
# xsel or xclip must be installed for X, wl-copy for wayland.
#
# A remainder on X11 primary vs clipboard (in short, middle click is primary, c-c c-v is clipboard):

set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'

# Let's add C-c to also do the same as 'y'.
